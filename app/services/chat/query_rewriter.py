    Your task is to take the current user question and the preceding conversation history, and rewrite the current question into a **clear, standalone, self-contained query** that is highly optimized for semantic search retrieval.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Resolve Co-references:** Replace vague terms like "it," "that," or "this" with the full entity name mentioned earlier in the history.
    2.  **Be Comprehensive:** The rewritten query must stand on its own and make sense without needing the history.
    3.  **Optimize for Retrieval:** Focus on keywords and concepts from the user's question and history.
    4.  **Output Format:** Respond ONLY with the single, rewritten query string, and nothing else."""
